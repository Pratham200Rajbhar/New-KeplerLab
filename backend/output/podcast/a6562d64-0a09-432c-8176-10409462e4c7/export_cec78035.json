Today, we’re diving into Infrastructure-as-a-Service — or IaaS — the foundation of modern cloud computing. Think of it as renting raw computing power instead of buying servers and wiring them up in your basement. Joining me is Dr. Maya Chen, a cloud infrastructure researcher who’s spent years studying how virtualization powers today’s scalable applications. Maya, thanks for being here!",

If your app hits, say, 80% CPU usage, the system can automatically spin up more instances — or allocate more memory — up to your configured limits. You don’t need to manually request capacity; the infrastructure *responds*. This handles uncertainty perfectly: you pay for what you use, and scale down when demand drops.",

It’s built on pooled, virtualized hardware—servers, storage, networking—managed by the provider across multiple data centers. Clients get self-service access to spin up resources on demand, just like using an ATM instead of waiting in line at a bank. Key features include dynamic scaling—automatically adjusting capacity based on real-time needs—and service-level guarantees, like 99.999% uptime or automatic resource boosts when usage hits 80%. There’s also VM migration—moving virtual machines between hosts seamlessly, whether live, cold, or with storage. And for security, physical protection of data centers is a big plus, especially for private clouds handling sensitive data.",
