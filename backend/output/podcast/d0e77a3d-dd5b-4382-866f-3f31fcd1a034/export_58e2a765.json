Why do companies move from physical servers to the cloud? What does it actually mean to rent infrastructure instead of buy it? And how do virtual machines keep everything running smoothly? To help us unpack this, I’m thrilled to welcome Sarah Lin, cloud infrastructure strategist and author of 'Virtualized Futures.' Sarah, thanks for being here!",

The VM gets provisioned, started, and is ready to serve within SLA timelines. And when the service ends — say, a temporary project wraps up — the VM is released, freeing those resources.

It’s built on pooled, physical hardware across multiple data centers, managed entirely by the cloud provider, while customers get virtualized resources to build their own IT platforms. A big part of IaaS is *self-service*—like an ATM for IT—letting users handle routine tasks without manual intervention. Then there’s *dynamic scaling*: resources automatically adjust up or down based on real-time demand, which is huge for handling uncertainty. Providers also offer varying *service levels*, from best-effort to high-availability guarantees—like 99.999% uptime—and may include features like VM migration for seamless movement between servers. And let’s not forget *physical security*: data centers hosting public or private clouds are protected at the facility level.",
