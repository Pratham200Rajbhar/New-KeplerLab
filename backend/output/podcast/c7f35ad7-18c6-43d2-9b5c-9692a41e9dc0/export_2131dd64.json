Today, we’re diving into Infrastructure as a Service, or IaaS—what it actually is, how it powers modern apps, and why it’s become the backbone of so many digital transformations. We’ll break down the mechanics, the benefits, and even the security realities. Joining us is Dr. Priya Mehta, a cloud infrastructure researcher and author of several industry whitepapers on virtualization. Priya, thanks for being here!",

It’s built on virtualized hardware—servers, storage, networking—pooled across multiple data centers, all managed by the provider. Clients get self-service access to spin up resources on demand, much like using an ATM for banking: quick, automated, and rule-based. Key features include dynamic scaling—automatically adjusting capacity based on real-time needs—and flexible service models, from pay-as-you-go to contracts with strict uptime guarantees, like 99.999% availability. There’s also VM migration—moving virtual machines between hosts seamlessly, whether live, cold, or with storage. And for security, physical protection of data centers is a big plus, especially for private clouds handling sensitive data.",
